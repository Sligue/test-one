Developer notes:

- This scaffold is minimal and intended as a starting point.
- Next steps: implement authentication pages using Supabase auth, protected routes, listing create/edit flows, image uploads to Supabase Storage, real-time chat via Supabase Realtime, and admin UI.
- Use `sql/seed.sql` to initialize tables in your Supabase project's SQL editor.
